# Starting of
Initially the challenge starts with a very simple website. We have an input field which we can submit with an unlock button. If we press the button we make Post request to **/unlock**. If we enter anything but digits we get an Internal Server Error. Otherwise the website tells us what number it expected us to enter which is a 8 digit number every time.

After typing a few different paths into the URL or launching gobuster we find that there exists and **/admin** page. Unfortunately this one is also super simple and only tells us where the "Lock location" is which is "Front door". Examining the source code of this site we see that there is a comment:
{% highlight html %}
<!-- We should be using get-config for this on the client side. -->
{% endhighlight %}

Googling for get-config did not yield anything useful. But plugging it into the URL gets us to the page **get-config**. This website is even more simplistic. It says "Front door". But the source code reveals that **/get-config** actually gives a xml-file:
{% highlight xml %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><config><location>Front door</location></config>
{% endhighlight %}

Mmh strange... But if there is a get-config maybe there also is a set-config. Indeed **/set-config** which tells us we made a bad request. Well setting something without giving parameter surely makes few sence so lets try to add a parameter. After trying around a bit I found that "data" is the correct get parameter we have to set. We could also find it with gobuster using:

```
gobuster fuzz -u http://base-url/set-config?FUZZ -w wordlist
```

Okay putting it all together. "/get-config" gives us an XML-file with a <location>-node. It appears that this content is used in the admin page to display to us "Front door". Lets try to set the config to

{% highlight xml %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><config><location>test</location></config>
{% endhighlight %}

to prove that we are right. Indeed the admin page displays "test" now.

# XXE

A well known vulnearbility in XML is XXE. We can sometimes use XML entities to read system files. This is because we can set variables inside an XML document using Document Type Definition. This can be done like this:
```
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file"> ]><location>&xxe;</location>
```

!DOCTYPE foo defines the doctype of our XML-file and <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file"> says that we want an entity called xxe which is the content of "file". This variable can then be referenced with &xxe from our XML-file. The only question now is: What do we want to read?

I used the tip here that our application runs with "uwsgi-nginx-flask-docker". A short search for this reveals that there is a file "/app/uwsgi.ini" to configure our main module. This doesnt exist though but **uwsgi.ini** does and it tells us that the main module is "main" thus there must be a **main.py**. Lets read this one. BUT since we have special characters like ! and & in our URL then we have to encode our parameter first with URL-encoding. Jackpot it works. We get the code snipped that is responsible to unlock the website given the correct input:

{% highlight python %}
from flask import Flask, abort, redirect, request, Response, session
from jinja2 import Template
import base64, json, os, random, re, subprocess, time, xml.sax
from cStringIO import StringIO

from rng import *

----------------------------CUT---------------------------------

@app.route('/unlock', methods=['POST'])
def unlock():
   code = int(request.form['code'])
   cur = next(26)
   time.sleep(5)

   if code == cur:
      return 'Unlocked successfully.  Flag: ' + flags[1]
   else:
      return 'Code incorrect.  Expected %08i' % cur
----------------------------CUT---------------------------------
{% endhighlight %}

I have cut out the irrelevant parts for brevity. Mmh weird **next(26)** throws an error if I try to run it on my machine. Maybe its imported from rng. Since rng is not built in, there could be another file **rng.py**. This is the case and its content is:

{% highlight python %}
def setup(seed):
   global state
   state = 0
   for I in xrange(16):
      cur = seed & 3
      seed >>= 2
      state = (state << 4) | ((state & 3) ^ cur)
      state |= cur << 2

def next(bits):
   global state

   ret = 0
   for I in xrange(bits):
      ret <<= 1
      ret |= state & 1
      state = (state << 1) ^ (state >> 61)
      state &= 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
      state ^= 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

      for j in xrange(0, 64, 4):
         cur = (state >> j) & 0xF
         cur = (cur >> 3) | ((cur >> 2) & 2) | ((cur << 3) & 8) | ((cur << 2) & 4)
         state ^= cur << j

   return ret

setup((random.randrange(0x10000) << 16) | random.randrange(0x10000))
{% endhighlight %}

Now we see that every time the server starts up it generates a random seed and calculates a 64-bit **state** from this number:
```
setupt((random.randrange(0x10000) << 16) | random.randrange(0x10000))
```

If we then want to unlock the website **next(26)** is used to generate a pseudo-random number from the state. Also the state is changed by this function. Our only chance to succeed is predicting this number somehow.


# Doing the Math

To crack the lock we have to calculate what the future pseudo-random numbers will be given the previous numbers where which we can get from our website.

## next() function

Lets first analyse the next function. Initally **ret** is set to 0. Then we have "bits" inner iterations. In each iteration we push the lowest bit of **state** to the right of **ret**. After this the **state** is changed by multiple operations. My initail approach was to simply name each bit of my state. "abcd...xyzABC...XYZ0...9?!" and calculate how this would change. I hoped that something would cancel and we ended up with an easy equation but that was not the case. It quickly got too complicated too keep track of.

But what I found this way was how the inner loop worked. It only changes 4 bits of the **state** at a time and the moves on to the next 4 bits. If we name these 4 bits ABCD we find that it replaces them with (A^D)(B^D)(C^A)(D^A). So if our state was say ABCDEFGH... then it changes to (A^D)(B^D)(C^A)(D^A)(E^H)(F^H)(G^E)(H^E)...
Now with that in mind we see that we can simply remove the line "state ^= 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF" from our next() function because (A^1^D^1) = (A^D) and similar for every other pair. Furthermore we note that state &= 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF simply cuts off the 65th bit which we could get by (state<<1).

## A more sophisticated approach

As I mentioned the previous approach quickly got too complicated. A more sophisticated approach is to imagine our state to be a bitvector of dimension 64 with the first component beeing the 64-th bit, the second one the 63-rd and so on. Lets call our **state's bit vector** **b**. Also notice that we have:

A^B = (A+B)%2, A^B^C = (A+B+C)%2 and so on.

With this in mind we can represent our operations by 64x64 matrices which we multiplicate  with our bitvector and take modulo 2 of the result in each component. The first two representations would look like this:
```
---(state << 1)----     ---(state >> 61)---
0 1 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0     0 0 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0 ... 0 0 0     0 0 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0 ... 0 0 0     0 0 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0
.   .   .   .   .       .   .   .   .   .    
.   .   .   .   .       .   .   .   .   .    
.   .   .   .   .       .   .   .   .   .      
0 0 0 0 0 ... 0 1 0     1 0 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 ... 0 0 1     0 1 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0     0 0 1 0 0 ... 0 0 0            
```
Note that we could also reimplement matrixmultiplication to use the operator "^" instead of "+" but that would yield the same result.

Next if we call these previous two matrices A and B then as long as **b** only contains 0 and 1 we also have:

A**b** ^ B**b** = ((A+B)%2)**b**

In the same way as before we can represent the inner for-loop of next() as a matrix C operating on our bitvector **b** and can then describe a full outer for loop with:

((A+B)%2)**b** ^ C **b** = ((A+B+C)%2)**b**

So lets set F = (A+B+C)%2 then F describes a full outer loop of the **next** function.

What does this yield to us? We now know, given an **initial state**, how we can calculate the **state** after any number of outer iterations. Furthermore since **ret** is actually returned to us by the function next() we know what it is after 26 iterations because the website will give this number to us. But the n-th bit of **ret** is the lowest bit of **state** after n iterations (counting the bits starting from 0). So we know:

How we can calculate the **lowest bit of state** for any given number of iterations from the **inital state**

And what it actually is after the number of iterations.

So we have a system of equations which we can maybe solve using [gaussian elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination). It looks somwhat like this:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/gauss.png)

On the right we have the bits of ret in each iteration and on the left we have which of the inital state's bits need to be xored to get this result. But the classical gauss works with addition not with xor. In our case we 1 ^ 1 = 0 not = 2. Thus I implemented the gaussian elimination for xor. Hoping that this was enough I generated a whole lot of variables untill I had more than 150 equations but the system kept beeing unsolvable... This means we need to find more relation but where? Well the only place we did not look yet is the **setup()** function.

## setup() function

The setup function starts by setting state to 0 and the does the following 
{% highlight python %}
for I in xrange(16):
      cur = seed & 3
      seed >>= 2
      state = (state << 4) | ((state & 3) ^ cur)
      state |= cur << 2
{% endhighlight %}
 
Analyzing this we find that given a previous state **prev_state** our state after one iteration will be the **prev_state** bits concatenated with the lowest two **seed** bits concatenated with the lowest two **seed** bits xored with the lowest two **prev_state** bits. To illustrate this we can say:
```
state = prev_state | seed[0:1] | seed[0:1] ^ prev_state[0:1]
```
furthermore our **seed** will be shifted 2 to the right for the next iteration.

From this we can derive more equations. Lets say we call the first bits of **state** ABCD then we get:

```
A = C <=> A^C = 0
B = D <=> B^D = 0
```

and for the following 4 bits EFGH we get:
```
G^E = C <=> G^E^C = 0
H^F = D <=> H^F^D = 0
```
And similar for every following 4 bits.

This yields us the following equations that our **inital state** fulfills by construction:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/moreEq.png)

If we add these to our system of equations we can predict the initial state with only 2 variables from the website. Knowing the initial state we can then call **next(26)** as often as we want an predict what the website will spit out in the future. Thus we can enter the correct value to unlock the lock.

# python code

Since the code I used for solving is a little longer I uploaded it to github. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/crush3dices/Model-E1337/blob/main/Model-E1337.py) if you have problems programming it or simply find sourcecode easier to read than my article haha (ofcourse you don't!).
