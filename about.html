<p><b>The purpose</b> of this blog is to share what I learn. The content will be mostly It-related, maybe I will also add mathematics at some point. I will frequently post about stuff I learn or learned a while ago and hope you enjoy the content. Since I also enjoy doing CTF's I will also make writeups for those enjoyed the most. If you find any faults in my posts or want to add something I am glad for any feedback.</p>

<p><b>About me:</b> I am Frederick, a computer-science and mathematics student with a bachelor degree in both of them. I am 26 years old and in currently studying towards my master in mathematics in Muenster/Germany. In my sparetime I like to learn about it-security since it is what currently interests me the most. I try to expand my knowledge so that I can become succesfull in bug-bountys or maybe work as a pentester after my masters degree.</p>
