<p><b>The purpose</b> of this blog is to share what i learn. The content will be mostly It-related, maybe i will also add mathematics at some point. I will frequently post about stuff i learn or learned a while ago and hope you enjoy the content. Since i also enjoy doing CTF's i will also make writeups for those enjoyed the most. If you find any faults in my posts or want to add something i am glad for any feedback.</p>

<p><b>About me:</b> I am Frederick, a computer-science and mathematics student with a bachelor degree in both of them. I am 26 years old and in currently studying towards my master in mathematics in Muenster/Germany. In my sparetime i like to learn about it-security since it is what currently interests me the most. I try to expand my knowledge so that i can become succesfull in bug-bountys or maybe work as a pentester after my masters degree.</p>
